## Future Plans
If I have time to come back to this project, I plan to add the following features:
- **Product Pages**: Allow users to view each product on a separate page.
- **Animations**: Add clean animations that help direct attention throughout the site.
- **Dark Mode**: Give users the option to enable dark mode across the site.

## Reflections

If I were to redo this project, I would plan out the components beforehand. I would break things down into smaller, more manageable components that I could reuse to make the codebase easier to maintain and extend. I would also try to focus on accessibility more in future projects.
